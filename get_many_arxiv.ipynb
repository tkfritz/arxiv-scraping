      "AE Aqr objects are a class of cataclysmic variable stars in which the rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the white dwarf (WD) primary centrifugally expels most infalling gas before it can accrete onto the WD. The expulsion of the accretion flow via this \"magnetic propeller\" extracts angular momentum from the WD and produces large-amplitude, aperiodic flares in optical photometry. The eponymous AE Aqr is the only confirmed member of this class of object, but recently, Thorstensen (2020) discovered a candidate AE Aqr system: LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9. Using survey photometry, we measure a refined orbital period for this system and identify a shallow, previously unrecognized eclipse during which the system's frequent AE Aqr-like flaring episodes cease. A dedicated follow-up study is still necessary to test the proposed AE Aqr classification for LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9, but should it be confirmed, the eclipse of its flare-production region will offer a new means of studying the magnetic propeller phenomenon.\n",

      "The presence of massive stars (MSs) in the region close to the Galactic Center (GC) poses several questions about their origin. The harsh environment of the GC favors specific formation scenarios, each of which should imprint characteristic kinematic features on the MSs. We present a 2D kinematic analysis of MSs in a GC region surrounding Sgr A* based on high-precision proper motions obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Thanks to a careful data reduction, well-measured bright stars in our proper-motion catalogs have errors better than 0.5 mas yr$^{-1}$. We discuss the absolute motion of the MSs in the field and their motion relative to Sgr A*, the Arches and the Quintuplet. For the majority of the MSs, we rule out any distance further than 3-4 kpc from Sgr A* using only kinematic arguments. If their membership to the GC is confirmed, most of the isolated MSs are likely not associated with either the Arches or Quintuplet clusters or Sgr A*. Only a few MSs have proper motions suggesting they are likely members of the Arches cluster, in agreement with previous spectroscopic results. Line-of-sight radial velocities and distances are required to shed further light on the origin of most of these massive objects. We also present an analysis of other fast-moving objects in the GC region, finding no clear excess of high-velocity escaping stars. We make our astro-photometric catalogs publicly available.\n",

      "Theoretical study is presented for a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose two components are coupled by copropagating Raman beams with different orbital angular momenta. The investigation is focused on the behavior of the ground state of this condensate, depending on the atom-light coupling strength. By analyzing the ground state, we have identified a number of quantum phases, which reflect the symmetries of the effective Hamiltonian and are characterized by the specific structure of the wave function. In addition to the well-known stripe, polarized and zero-momentum phases, our results show that the system can support phases, whose wave function contains a complex vortex molecule. Such molecule plays an important role in the continuous phase transitions of the system. The predicted behavior of vortex-molecule phases can be examined in cold-atom experiments using currently existing techniques.\n",
